5. Page Structure Decision
Approach: Hybrid Multi-Page Site with Smooth Scroll Features
I've chosen a multi-page structure for better SEO, load times, and user navigation clarity:
Why Multi-Page:

Each page can be individually optimized for specific keywords
Faster initial page load (not loading all content at once)
Clearer navigation structure for users
Easier to maintain and scale

Smooth Scroll Integration:

Within pages (e.g., Home page sections)
Navigation transitions between pages with fade effects
Anchor links on longer pages (About, Projects)

Page Breakdown:

Home: Hero section + Featured projects preview + About snippet
About: Full biography with animated skill bars and timeline
Projects: Grid layout with filtering, each card links to detail view
Project Detail: Individual page for each project (PHP template)
Contact: Form and information page


6. GreenSock (GSAP) Enhancements
Planned Animations
Homepage:

Hero Text Animation: Staggered fade-in and slide-up for heading and subheading
Logo/Icon Animation: Morphing SVG animation on load
Scroll Indicator: Animated bouncing arrow/icon

Navigation:

Smooth Scroll: Custom scrollTo plugin for anchor links
Nav Background: Fade in background on scroll past hero

About Page:

Skill Bars: Animated progress bars triggered on scroll into view
Timeline Animations: Fade and slide items as user scrolls

Projects Page:

Grid Items: Staggered fade-in animation on load
Hover Effects: Scale and shadow transitions (enhanced with GSAP)
Image Parallax: Background images move at different speeds during scroll

General:

Page Transitions: Fade out/in when navigating between pages
Scroll Reveal: Elements fade and slide into view as user scrolls (ScrollTrigger plugin)

GSAP Plugins Used

ScrollToPlugin: For smooth scroll navigation
Core GSAP: For timeline-based animations


7. Additional Interactivity
